High-Level App Pitch:
The best part of starting a game is always building your character. Now, there's an app that applies that same min-maxing to your real-life goals. It's where you can find everything you've been putting off, from dance lessons to personal finance workshops. This app connects users with local businesses, creating a marketplace where you can pick up a new skill or improve an old one. Businesses gain exposure and clientele, while users get practical steps to self-improvement – it's a win-win, driving revenue from both ends in a way that's never been done before.

For now, we just want to build the quiz that measures where you are in the journey for the app. This is the first step to building the foundation for connecting you to a business that can help improve yourself, and this standalone app will help showcase the tech & features.

Quiz App First Step:
Imagine an app that's like a personal coach in your pocket, but instead of generic advice, it starts with a clever quiz that truly understands you. This isn't just any quiz – it's a deep dive into who you are and where you stand in key life skills, from your physical fitness to your knack for learning new things. By simply answering questions, you get a personalized map of your strengths and also your areas to grow, like a D&D character sheet for real life. Whether it's boosting your confidence, learning a new language, or getting in shape, this app pinpoints exactly where you should start and how to get to where you want to be. It's not just about self-improvement; it's about self-discovery, tailored specifically to you.
